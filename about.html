        <div class="aboutMe-container">
            <p>Currently based in Aalborg, while in my first year of studying Media Graphics at Aalborg TECHCOLLEGE,
            I create designs and art with inspiration from my everyday environment and online media.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It has always been interesting to me to work with Digital Media and Communication and I've had a fair amount of experience from my former fields of educations and side hobbies at home.
                Whether it would be artwork, UX design, graphics, video content or running social media, I would like to strengthen my skills further within these areas. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Coming all the way from Vietnam and spending most of my life in Denmark, 
                I've adjusted myself to a different environment and culture, 
                which makes me open to understand and explore more new experiences within this world.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe that with a curious and open-minded approach to everything, you can adapt and make your contributions to everything more effective and enjoyable.</p>
            <p>Designing is something I'd like to pursue as my ideal form of work and personal expression, and getting out to the world with my work is a goal I am determined to fulfill.</p>
